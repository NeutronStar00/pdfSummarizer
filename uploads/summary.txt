Building Materials

1. Bricks

* Properties:
    * Durability: Determined by achieving incipient fusion and partial vitrification during firing, influencing compressive strength, absorption, and saturation coefficient.
    * Color: Influenced by chemical composition, firing temperatures, and firing control methods, with iron causing shades of red in oxidizing fires and dark hues in reducing atmospheres.
    * Texture: Determined by the dies or molds used in forming, resulting in smooth or sand-finished textures.
    * Size variation: Accounted for during manufacturing to achieve desired size, with variations occurring due to drying and firing shrinkage.
    * Compressive strength and absorption: Interrelated with properties of clay and manufacturing methods, with higher firing temperatures yielding higher strength and lower absorption.

* Manufacturing:
    * Rail kilns: Bricks are fired as they move slowly through continuous tunnel kilns on conveyors, rails, or kiln cars.
    * Bull's Trench Kilns: Bricks are stacked in an oval or circular trench, with a tall exhaust chimney in the center. Fuel is dropped through holes in the roof to create airflow and heat the bricks.

* Uses:
    * Building, block paving, and pavement
    * Brickwork linings in metallurgy and glass industries
    * Engineering bricks: Where strength, low water porosity, or acid resistance are needed

2. Cement

* Definition: A binder that hardens independently, can bind other materials together, and traces back to the Roman term "opus caementicium."

* Types:
    * Ordinary Portland cement (OPC): Most commonly used type, made from limestone, clay, and other materials heated to 1450 Â°C and ground with gypsum.
    * Rapid hardening Portland cement: Similar to OPC but contains higher lime content, requiring finer grinding for increased strength.
    * Low heat Portland cement: Contains increased lime content and is ground to a finer extent than OPC, resulting in a slower rate of heat generation during setting and hardening.
    * Portland Blast Furnace cement: Made by intergrinding Portland cement clinker with blast furnace slag, offering advantages in concrete structures exposed to sulfate environments.
    * Portland pozzolana cement: Made by intergrinding Portland cement clinker with pozzolana, which enhances resistance to chemical deterioration and sulfate attack.
    * White cement: Similar in composition and strength to OPC but with reduced iron oxide content, resulting in a white color.
    * Colored cement: Obtained by adding pigments to OPC, with different pigments used to achieve various colors.
    * Sulfate resisting cement: Contains higher proportions of Tri-calcium silicate and Di-calcium silicate, rendering it resistant to sulfates.
    * Hydrophobic cement: Treated with water repellant chemicals to prevent moisture absorption and spoilage during storage or transportation.
    * Oil well cement: Designed for sealing deep oil wells at high temperatures.
    * Air entrainment cement: Contains air-entraining agents to increase workability and frost resistance of concrete.

* Physical and Chemical Requirements: As per IS standards, specific criteria must be met for fineness, soundness, setting time, compressive strength, and chemical composition.

* Role of Various Ingredients:
    * Silica: Provides strength
    * Lime: Provides strength, but excess can lead to expansion
    * Alumina: Quickens setting time
    * Iron oxide: Provides color and hardness
    * Magnesia: Provides hardness and color, but excess can affect soundness

3. Concrete and Mortar Materials

* Workability: The ease with which concrete can be placed and compacted, influenced by factors such as water content, aggregate gradation, and admixtures.
* Strength Properties of Concrete: Compressive strength is the primary strength parameter, with higher strength achieved through higher cement content, lower water-cement ratio, and proper curing.
* Nominal Proportion of Concrete: Proportions of cement, sand, and coarse aggregate are specified based on the desired strength and workability.
* Preparation of Concrete: Proper mixing, placing, and curing are crucial for achieving desired concrete properties.
* Compaction Curving: Consolidation of concrete using vibration or other methods to remove entrapped air and achieve maximum density.
* Mortar: A mixture of cement, sand, and water used as a bonding material in masonry construction. Its properties and uses vary depending on the type of cement used and the ratio of cement to sand.
